## Building from Source on macOS
The source files in [source](source) can be rendered in the [DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com/) GUI desktop application, but you might need to mess with the font locations and paths a bit to get the fonts to work.

If you prefer the command line, see the pip install instructions here: https://github.com/typemytype/drawbot

Then, run the source files from the root dicectory of this repository:
```
python3 source/2020-02.py
```
If that works there should be a new pdf in the [pdfs](pdfs) directory, and a new png in the [images](images) directory.

## Building from Source on Linux
Unfortunatly DrawBot is macOS only software for now, but I plan to help port it to Linux this year, so please reach out to me if you would like to help with this effort.
